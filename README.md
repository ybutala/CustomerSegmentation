# CustomerSegmentation

## Identifying Customer Demographics for Targeted Marketing

To optimize marketing strategies and minimize customer acquisition costs, we analyzed shopper data containing features such as spending scores, age, gender, and income. The goal was to identify the customer profile associated with the highest spending group, defined as having the maximum spending score.

Using KMeans clustering technique, we divided the data into five distinct clusters based on these features. One cluster stood out as the highest spending group, characterized by high income and a younger age demographic. This group comprises 54% women and 46% men, making it a balanced target audience. By focusing marketing efforts on this segment, businesses can maximize returns while maintaining cost efficiency.
